# Manifestation

Manifestation is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). This repository serves as a boilerplate for building scalable web applications with Next.js, TypeScript, and other modern web technologies.
